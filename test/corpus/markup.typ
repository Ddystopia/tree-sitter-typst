============
Basic markup
============

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet _yes I'm typing this out instead of using the builtin function_,
consecteur adispicing elit \ *And now some bold text after a linebreak*.

// This is a comment
/* These are /* nested */ block comments */

`Inline raw text` also works.
